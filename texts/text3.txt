About 2 years ago I bought 3 pairs of these very same scissors. I was so pleased with them that I just bought 3 more pairs. The major qualities that make them so great is they are made of a very high quality steel that cuts & cuts without any detectable loss of sharpness. They cut through paper like butter, and can make extremely straight cuts with just a fine, thin pencil line as your guide. I now keep two scissors in the kitchen, one in my office, one in my wife's desk area, one in my tool closet and and one in our living room bar area.
